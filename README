What: 
An Object Oriented interface to php's cURLing functions.

Why: Sanity. Well, that and I kept running into exhaustive classes for
twitter and last.fm when i just wanted something lightweight to throw 
up on my blog. I wrote the interface so I could just easily extend it
and get the very limited information I cared about. I've included both
of the extensions in the repository.

9.29.11: Added Google+ Support.

class simple_toots extends simple_api {
	// Now you have all my methods and stuffs.
